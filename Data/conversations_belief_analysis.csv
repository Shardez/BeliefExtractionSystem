Okay, let's break this down. The user says, ""I’d appreciate that. My grandson usually helps, but he’s busy with school lately. I feel so helpless."" 

First, I need to check if there are any expressions of user beliefs that relate to mental resilience or self-perception. The first part, ""I’d appreciate that,"" is a bit vague. It might be a polite statement, but not necessarily a belief. 

Then, ""My grandson usually helps, but he’s busy with school lately."" This is an observation about the grandson's current situation. The user is noting that the grandson isn't available anymore. 

The key part is ""I feel so helpless."" That's a strong expression of feeling powerless. The user is expressing a negative belief about their ability to handle the situation, which relates to self-efficacy. They feel they can't manage without the grandson's help, which is a sign of low self-efficacy. 

So, according to the classification criteria, this would fall under self-efficacy statements. The user is expressing insecurity in their ability to handle the situation, which affects their mental resilience. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.

Looking at the classification framework, the impact here is negative because feeling helpless is a self-limiting belief. It affects their sense of capability. 

Now, the dimension. The user is talking about their grandson's help, which relates to their personal situation. So the dimension is Personal. 

For the category, ""feeling helpless"" is a coping mechanism belief. They doubt their ability to handle the situation, which is a coping mechanism. 

Wait, but the user is expressing a feeling of helplessness, which is more about their self-perception. Maybe it's a self-efficacy statement? Or maybe a meaning-making statement? Hmm. 

Wait, the category options include Self-efficacy statement, which is about confidence in abilities. But here, the user is feeling helpless, which is a lack of confidence. So that's a Self-efficacy statement. But the user is not expressing confidence, so maybe it's a negative self-efficacy statement. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a Meaning-making statement if they're interpreting the situation as hopeless. But the main point is their feeling of helplessness, which is a belief about their own capabilities. So I think it's a Self-efficacy statement with a negative impact. 

So the belief is ""I feel so helpless."" Impact is Negative, Dimension Personal, Category Self-efficacy statement. 

Wait, but the user also mentions the grandson's help. Is that a belief? The user is saying that the grandson usually helps, but now he's busy. So maybe that's a statement about their reliance on others, which could be a coping mechanism belief. But the main belief is the feeling of helplessness. 

The user's main belief is that they can't handle the situation, which is a self-efficacy statement. So the answer should be that.
